## Simple website for Github Pages using Markdown Language Syntax


In this assignment, my task was to deploy a *website* using **Github Pages**.

On top of that i learned some basic markdown language syntax. I had not used this much before, but i will definitely be utilizing this in the future for basic text formatting.
