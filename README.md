## Simple website for Github Pages using Markdown Language Syntax


In this assignment, my task was to deploy a *website* using **Github Pages**.

On top of that i learned some ~~HTML~~ basic markdown language syntax. I had not used this much before, but i will definitely be utilizing this in the future for basic text formatting. 

**_It helps to make text more readable for others as well as yourself_.**

Lastly, a quote i found inspiring:
